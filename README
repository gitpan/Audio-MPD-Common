Audio::MPD::Common
==================

Audio::MPD::Common is a bunch of common classes used by both Audio::MPD
and POE::Component::Client::MPD (two modules meant to access Music
Player Daemon, aka mpd). Since those classes are independent of the
runloop (poe or non-poe aware), Audio::MPD::Common comes to the rescue.

Note that those classes are not meant to be use by anyone outside of
those two modules.
