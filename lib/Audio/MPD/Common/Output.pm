=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD::Common::Output - class representing MPD output

=head1 VERSION

version 1.120881

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MPD server can have various outputs defined, generally one per sound
card. Those output can be queried with the mpd modules. Some of those
information are served to you as an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Output>
object.

An L<Audio::MPD::Common::Output> object does B<not> update itself
regularly, and thus should be used immediately.

Note: one should B<never> ever instantiate an
L<Audio::MPD::Common::Output> object directly - use the mpd modules
instead.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 $output->id;

Internal MPD id for the output.

=head2 $output->name;

Friendly-name for the output.

=head2 $output->enabled;

Boolean stating whether the output is enabled or not.
