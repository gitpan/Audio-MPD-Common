=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD::Common::Stats - class representing MPD stats

=head1 VERSION

version 1.120880

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MPD server maintains some general information. Those information can
be queried with the mpd modules. Some of those information are served to
you as an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats> object.

An L<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats> object does B<not> update itself
regularly, and thus should be used immediately.

Note: one should B<never> ever instantiate an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats>
object directly - use the mpd modules instead.
