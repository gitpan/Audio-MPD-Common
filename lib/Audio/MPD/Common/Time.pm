=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD::Common::Time - class representing time of current song

=head1 VERSION

version 1.120610

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Audio::MPD::Common::Status> returns some time information with the
C<time()> accessor. This information relates to the elapsed time of the
current song, as well as the remaining and total time. This information
is encapsulated in an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Time> object.

An L<Audio::MPD::Common::Time> object does B<not> update itself
regularly, and thus should be used immediately.

Note: one should B<never> ever instantiate an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Time>
object directly - use the mpd modules instead.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 $time->time;

The time passed to the constructor, used to compute all others values
(see methods). It is the time value (on the "time" line) of what the MPD
server returns to the status command. Defaults to C<0:0>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 my $str = $time->sofar;

Return elapsed C<$time> (C<minutes:seconds> format).

=head2 my $str = $time->left;

Return remaining C<$time> (C<minutes:seconds> format).

=head2 my $str = $time->left;

Return total C<$time> (C<minutes:seconds> format).

=head2 my $percent = $time->percent;

Return elapsed C<$time> (percentage, 1 digit).

=head2 my $secs = $time->seconds_sofar;

Return elapsed C<$time> in seconds.

=head2 my $secs = $time->seconds_left;

Return remaining C<$time> in seconds.

=head2 my $secs = $time->seconds_total;

Return total C<$time> in seconds.

=head2 my $mins = $time->sofar_mins;

Return minutes part of elapsed C<$time>.

=head2 my $secs = $time->sofar_secs;

Return seconds part of elapsed C<$time>.

=head2 my $mins = $time->left_mins;

Return minutes part of remaining C<$time>.

=head2 my $secs = $time->left_secs;

Return seconds part of remaining C<$time>.

=head2 my $mins = $time->total_mins;

Return minutes part of total C<$time>.

=head2 my $mins = $time->total_secs;

Return seconds part of total C<$time>.
